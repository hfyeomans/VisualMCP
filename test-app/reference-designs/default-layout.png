# Reference Design Placeholder

This directory should contain reference design images for comparison testing.

For actual implementation, you would place PNG/JPEG files here such as:
- default-layout.png
- compact-layout.png  
- wide-layout.png
- broken-layout.png

These images serve as the "expected" designs that the Visual MCP will compare against when taking screenshots of the test app.

To generate these reference images:
1. Run the test app: `cd test-app && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to each layout mode
3. Take manual screenshots or use the MCP screenshot tool
4. Save them as reference images in this directory
